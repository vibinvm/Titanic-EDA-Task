# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
To analyze the Titanic dataset using statistics and visualization techniques.

## Steps Performed
- Generated summary statistics
- Checked missing values
- Created histograms and boxplots
- Analyzed survival distribution
- Examined survival by gender and passenger class
- Built correlation heatmap
- Used pairplot to study feature relationships

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Findings
- Females had higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers survived more.
- Fare is positively correlated with survival.
- Age and Fare show skewness and outliers.

## Conclusion
EDA helped understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset before modeling.
